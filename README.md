Just a quick test to see what's possible with the new [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) tool! 

The script was primarily written by ChatGPT, but I had do some light clean-up (importing libraries, creating the HTML, etc.).

This was made using the following workflow: 
* Creating a simple scene (sphere, gridhelper, camera, etc.) in threejs
* Adding slider to control number of segments
* Adding rotation controls
* Adding slider to control scale
* Adding Export .STL functionality
